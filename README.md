## XVRU OS

#### XVRU OS is my personal project trying to understand how operating systems work. It is a hobby project and is not intended to be used in production.
#### Also, This code is not clean and is not intended to be used as a reference.

### Building
#### To build the kernel, you need to have the following tools installed:
- `i386-elf-toolchain`
- `make`
- `nasm`
- `qemu-system-i386`
#### To build the kernel, run `make` in the root directory of the project.
